       "[Document(page_content='\\nüëã Welcome to Lil‚ÄôLog\\n\\nHi, this is Lilian. I‚Äôm documenting my learning notes in this blog. Besides, I‚Äôm leading a team working on practical AI safety and alignment at OpenAI. Based on the number of grammar mistakes in my posts, you can tell how much ChatGPT is involved üòâ.\\n\\nDiffusion Models for Video Generation\\n    \\n\\nDiffusion models have demonstrated strong results on image synthesis in past years. Now the research community has started working on a harder task‚Äîusing it for video generation. The task itself is a superset of the image case, since an image is a video of 1 frame, and it is much more challenging because:\\nIt has extra requirements on temporal consistency across frames in time, which naturally demands more world knowledge to be encoded into the model....\\n\\nThinking about High-Quality Human Data\\n    \\n\\n[Special thank you to Ian Kivlichan for many useful pointers (E.g. the 100+ year old Nature paper ‚ÄúVox populi‚Äù) and nice feedback. üôè ]\\nHigh-quality data is the fuel for modern data deep learning model training. Most of the task-specific labeled data comes from human annotation, such as classification task or RLHF labeling (which can be constructed as classification format) for LLM alignment training. Lots of ML techniques in the post can help with data quality, but fundamentally human data collection involves attention to details and careful execution....\\n\\nAdversarial Attacks on LLMs\\n    \\n\\nThe use of large language models in the real world has strongly accelerated by the launch of ChatGPT. We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via RLHF). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.\\nA large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space....\\n\\nLLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\n    \\n\\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent‚Äôs brain, complemented by several key components:...\\n\\nPrompt Engineering\\n    \\n\\nPrompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.\\nThis post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models....\\n\\nThe Transformer Family Version 2.0\\n    \\n\\nMany new Transformer architecture improvements have been proposed since my last post on ‚ÄúThe Transformer Family‚Äù about three years ago. Here I did a big refactoring and enrichment of that 2020 post ‚Äî restructure the hierarchy of sections and improve many sections with more recent papers. Version 2.0 is a superset of the old version, about twice the length.\\nNotations Symbol Meaning $d$ The model size / hidden state dimension / positional encoding size....\\n\\nLarge Transformer Model Inference Optimization\\n    \\n\\n[Updated on 2023-01-24: add a small section on Distillation.]\\nLarge transformer models are mainstream nowadays, creating SoTA results for a variety of tasks. They are powerful but very expensive to train and use. The extremely high inference cost, in both time and memory, is a big bottleneck for adopting a powerful transformer for solving real-world tasks at scale.\\nWhy is it hard to run inference for large transformer models? Besides the increasing size of SoTA models, there are two main factors contributing to the inference challenge (Pope et al....\\n\\nSome Math behind Neural Tangent Kernel\\n    \\n\\nNeural networks are well known to be over-parameterized and can often easily fit data with near-zero training loss with decent generalization performance on test dataset. Although all these parameters are initialized at random, the optimization process can consistently lead to similarly good outcomes. And this is true even when the number of model parameters exceeds the number of training data points.\\nNeural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al. 2018) is a kernel to explain the evolution of neural networks during training via gradient descent....\\n\\nGeneralized Visual Language Models\\n    \\n\\nProcessing images to generate text, such as image captioning and visual question-answering, has been studied for years. Traditionally such systems rely on an object detection network as a vision encoder to capture visual features and then produce text via a text decoder. Given a large amount of existing literature, in this post, I would like to only focus on one approach for solving vision language tasks, which is to extend pre-trained generalized language models to be capable of consuming visual signals....\\n\\nLearning with not Enough Data Part 3: Data Generation\\n    \\n\\nHere comes the Part 3 on learning with not enough data (Previous: Part 1 and Part 2). Let‚Äôs consider two approaches for generating synthetic data for training.\\nAugmented data. Given a set of existing training samples, we can apply a variety of augmentation, distortion and transformation to derive new data points without losing the key attributes. We have covered a bunch of augmentation methods on text and images in a previous post on contrastive learning....\\n\\nLearning with not Enough Data Part 2: Active Learning\\n    \\n\\nThis is part 2 of what to do when facing a limited amount of labeled data for supervised learning tasks. This time we will get some amount of human labeling work involved, but within a budget limit, and therefore we need to be smart when selecting which samples to label.\\nNotations Symbol Meaning $K$ Number of unique class labels. $(\\\\mathbf{x}^l, y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{X}, y \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}^K$ Labeled dataset. $y$ is a one-hot representation of the true label....\\n\\nLearning with not Enough Data Part 1: Semi-Supervised Learning\\n    \\n\\nWhen facing a limited amount of labeled data for supervised learning tasks, four approaches are commonly discussed.\\nPre-training + fine-tuning: Pre-train a powerful task-agnostic model on a large unsupervised data corpus, e.g. pre-training LMs on free text, or pre-training vision models on unlabelled images via self-supervised learning, and then fine-tune it on the downstream task with a small set of labeled samples. Semi-supervised learning: Learn from the labelled and unlabeled samples together....\\n\\nHow to Train Really Large Models on Many GPUs?\\n    \\n\\n[Updated on 2022-03-13: add expert choice routing.] [Updated on 2022-06-10]: Greg and I wrote a shorted and upgraded version of this post, published on OpenAI Blog: ‚ÄúTechniques for Training Large Neural Networks‚Äù\\nIn recent years, we are seeing better results on many NLP benchmark tasks with larger pre-trained language models. How to train large and deep neural networks is challenging, as it demands a large amount of GPU memory and a long horizon of training time....\\n\\nWhat are Diffusion Models?\\n    \\n\\n[Updated on 2021-09-19: Highly recommend this blog post on score-based generative modeling by Yang Song (author of several key papers in the references)]. [Updated on 2022-08-27: Added classifier-free guidance, GLIDE, unCLIP and Imagen. [Updated on 2022-08-31: Added latent diffusion model. [Updated on 2024-04-13: Added progressive distillation, consistency models, and the Model Architecture section.\\nSo far, I‚Äôve written about three types of generative models, GAN, VAE, and Flow-based models. They have shown great success in generating high-quality samples, but each has some limitations of its own....\\n\\nContrastive Representation Learning\\n    \\n\\nThe goal of contrastive representation learning is to learn such an embedding space in which similar sample pairs stay close to each other while dissimilar ones are far apart. Contrastive learning can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised settings. When working with unsupervised data, contrastive learning is one of the most powerful approaches in self-supervised learning.\\nContrastive Training Objectives In early versions of loss functions for contrastive learning, only one positive and one negative sample are involved....\\n\\nReducing Toxicity in Language Models\\n    \\n\\nLarge pretrained language models are trained over a sizable collection of online data. They unavoidably acquire certain toxic behavior and biases from the Internet. Pretrained language models are very powerful and have shown great success in many NLP tasks. However, to safely deploy them for practical real-world applications demands a strong safety control over the model generation process.\\nMany challenges are associated with the effort to diminish various types of unsafe content:...\\n\\nControllable Neural Text Generation\\n    \\n\\n[Updated on 2021-02-01: Updated to version 2.0 with several work added and many typos fixed.] [Updated on 2021-05-26: Add P-tuning and Prompt Tuning in the ‚Äúprompt design‚Äù section.] [Updated on 2021-09-19: Add ‚Äúunlikelihood training‚Äù.]\\nThere is a gigantic amount of free text on the Web, several magnitude more than labelled benchmark datasets. The state-of-the-art language models (LM) are trained with unsupervised Web data in large scale. When generating samples from LM by iteratively sampling the next token, we do not have much control over attributes of the output text, such as the topic, the style, the sentiment, etc....\\n\\nHow to Build an Open-Domain Question Answering System?\\n    \\n\\n[Updated on 2020-11-12: add an example on closed-book factual QA using OpenAI API (beta).\\nA model that can answer any question with regard to factual knowledge can lead to many useful and practical applications, such as working as a chatbot or an AI assistantü§ñ. In this post, we will review several common approaches for building such an open-domain question answering system.\\nDisclaimers given so many papers in the wild:...\\n\\nNeural Architecture Search\\n    \\n\\nAlthough most popular and successful model architectures are designed by human experts, it doesn‚Äôt mean we have explored the entire network architecture space and settled down with the best option. We would have a better chance to find the optimal solution if we adopt a systematic and automatic way of learning high-performance model architectures.\\nAutomatically learning and evolving network topologies is not a new idea (Stanley & Miikkulainen, 2002). In recent years, the pioneering work by Zoph & Le 2017 and Baker et al....\\n\\nExploration Strategies in Deep Reinforcement Learning\\n    \\n\\n[Updated on 2020-06-17: Add ‚Äúexploration via disagreement‚Äù in the ‚ÄúForward Dynamics‚Äù section.\\nExploitation versus exploration is a critical topic in Reinforcement Learning. We‚Äôd like the RL agent to find the best solution as fast as possible. However, in the meantime, committing to solutions too quickly without enough exploration sounds pretty bad, as it could lead to local minima or total failure. Modern RL algorithms that optimize for the best returns can achieve good exploitation quite efficiently, while exploration remains more like an open topic....\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/'})]"

The salient features of \\nthe constitution are as follows: - \\n\\uf0b7 Lengthiest written Constitution  \\n\\uf0b7 Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility  \\n\\uf0b7 Federal system with unitary features  \\n\\uf0b7 Parliamentary form of Government  \\n\\uf0b7 Independent judiciary  \\n\\uf0b7 Single citizenship  \\n\\uf0b7 Emergency provision  \\nStructure: - The Indian Constitution originally consisted of 395 Art, 22 parts, 8 Schedules.  But \\nafter the Constitution 104th  Amendment Act, 2003, the Indian Con stitution Consists of 44 8 \\nArt, 2 5 parts, 12 Schedules.  \\nPreamble: - The preamble to the constitution is based on the ‚Äú objective resolution‚Äù  drafted and \\nmoved by Pandit Nehru and adopted by constituent assembly. It runs as follows: - \\n‚ÄúWe  THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,  having solemnly resolved to co nstitute India in to a SOVERIGN \\nSOCIALIST  SECULAR  DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizen: - \\n\\uf0b7 JUSTICE, social, Economic, and Political;  \\n\\uf0b7 LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;  \\n\\uf0b7 EQUALITY of status and of opportunity ;, \\n\\uf0b7 FRATERNITY  assuring  the dignity  of the individual  and the unity  and integrity  of the \\nnation;  In our Constituent  Assembly,  this 26th  November,  1949 , do hereby  adopt,  enact  \\nand give to ourselves  this constitution. ‚Äù \\nPurpose of the Preamble: - The preamble to the constitution is a key to open the minds of \\nthe makers and shows the general purpose for which they made the several provisions in \\nthe constitution. Preamble serves the following purposes: - \\n1. It discloses the source of the const itution . \\n2. It lays down the  date of the commencement of the constitution.  \\n3. It set out the rights and freedoms which the people of India wished to secure for \\nthemselves.  \\n4. It declares the nature of the government.  \\n \\nQ1:- Whether Preamble is the part of the const itution?  \\nAns.: - In the case of Kesvanand Bharti vs. State of Kerala , the supreme  has held that \\npreamble is part of the constitution. Preamble is of extreme importance and the \\nconstitution should be read and interpreted in the light of grand and noble vision \\nexpressed in the preamble. However, two things should be noted: - \\n\\uf0d8 The preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor prohibition upon the \\npowers of legislature.  \\n\\uf0d8    It is not justiciable  i.e. not enforceable in courts of law.  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'CONSTITUTION.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

The Preamble has been \\namended only once by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment act, which has added three new \\nwords - Socialistic, Secular and Integrity - to the  preamble.  \\n \\n \\nNature of Indian Constitution: -The Constitution is of two kinds: - \\n1. Unitary :- In a Unitary Constitutions the powers of the  Government are centralized in \\none  \\nGovernment v.z. the States or Provinces  are Subordinates to the Centre.  \\n2. Federal :- In Federal Constitution, there is a division of Powers between the federal and \\nthe  \\nState Government and both are independent in their own spheres. The American \\nConstitution is universally regarded as an example of the Federal Constitution.  \\n \\nCharacteristics of a federal Constitution: -  \\n \\n1. A Written Constitution  :-  For a federal Constitution it is Mandatory that there should be \\na written Constitution.  \\n2. Dual Government :- In case of federal constitution, there is system of dual government \\none at centre  and another at state.  \\n3. Supremacy of Constitutions :- For a federal Constitution there should be supremacy of \\nthe Constitution. At the time of the exercise of power by three organs of the Govt. i.e. \\nlegislative, executive and Judiciary, all functions are Sub ordinated and Controlled by the \\nConstitution.  \\n4. Distribution of Powers: - Federalism means the distribution of powers of the State \\namong a Number of Co -ordinate bodies each originating in and controlled by the \\nConstitution  \\n5. Rigidity: - Rigidity is one of the Ba sic essential of a federal Constitution. It highly depends \\non the Process of amendment.  \\n6. Independent Judiciary :- There should be an independent judiciary having authority on \\nother organs. In a federal Constitution the courts (judiciary) has the final power  to \\ninterpret the Constitution. Finally it should say that the judiciary is the Guardian of the \\nConstitution.  \\n  Conclusion  : Finally if can be said that the Indian Constitution  is neither Purely federal   nor \\npurely unitary  but a Unique Combination of Both  aspects.  \\n \\nPeculiar feature of Indian Constitution: - \\n\\uf0b7 Mode of formation  \\n\\uf0b7 Position of the state  \\n\\uf0b7 Citizenship  \\n\\uf0b7 Residuary power  \\n\\uf0b7 The lengthiest Constitution in the world.  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'CONSTITUTION.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Only the fundamental right can be enforced and not any oth er \\nright like statutory right, customary rights etc. The violation of fundamental right is \\nsine qua non for the applicability of article 32.

The right under \\nArt. 19 (1) (g) can only be claimed by citizens, but the right under Art.301  can be claimed by any \\none.  \\nThe word ‚Äú free‚Äù in Art.301 ‚Äì does not mean freedom from Laws or regulations. There is a clear \\ndistinction between laws interfering with freed om to carry out the activities constituting trade \\nand law imposing rules of proper con duct o r other restraints for the due and orderly manner of \\ncarrying out the activities. The distinction is known as regulations.  \\nThe word ‚Äúregulation‚Äù  has no fixed connotation. Its meaning differs according to the nature of \\nthe thing which it is applied.  A purely regulatory and compensatory law cannot be regarded \\nas violative of the freedom of trade and commerce. Such laws are intended merely to \\nregulate trade and commerce they tend, to facilitate, and not restrict or restrain freedom or \\ntrade. Thus, such  measures as traffic regulations, licensing of vehicles, charging for the \\nmaintenance of roads, marketing and health regulations, price control, economic and social \\nplanning prescribing minimum wages are purely regulatory measures., than a law which \\nlevies  a tax or toll for the use of a road or bridge is  not a barrier or burden on a trade but in \\nreality helps the free -flow of trade by enabling the provision of a mare convenient and less \\nexpensive route. Such compensatory taxes are no hindrance to any such freedom of trade so \\nlong as they are within reasonable limits, if the amount of such taxes are unduly high it \\ncertainly would hamper trade.  \\n   In this connection the Court has pointed ou t that the distinction between ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù  in Art 301 \\nand ‚Äú restriction ‚Äù in Art. 302 and 304 must be kept in mind, and that which, in reality \\nfacilitates trade cannot be a restriction. While that which actually hampers trade will be a  \\nrestriction.   ', metadata={'source': 'CONSTITUTION.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='   \\n16 \\n ‚ÄúThe Majority j udgement in the Atiabari Tea Co‚Äô s Case read with a majority judgement in the \\nAutomobile‚Äô s case le ad to the following principles relating of Art.301  \\n1. Art.301 assures freedom of inter -State as well as intra -State trade, Commerce and \\nintercourse.  \\n2. Trade, Commerce and intercourse have the widest connotation and take in mo vement \\nof goods and persons.  \\n3. The freedom is not only from laws enacted in the exercise of the powers conferred by \\nthe legislative entries relating to trade and commerce or production, supply and \\ndistribution of goods, but also to all laws including tax la ws. only those laws whose \\ndirect and immediate effect to inhibit or restrict freedom of trade or commerce will \\ncome with the mischief of Art.301. Laws which are merely regulatory or which impose \\npurely compensatory taxes, and hence intended to facilitate f reedom of trade, are \\noutside the scope Art. 301.  \\n4. Restrictions on Trade and Commerce ‚Äì Art 301 is subject to the restrictions imposed  \\nunder Art. 302 to 305.  \\n\\uf0b7 Parliament‚Äô s Power to regulate trade and commerce in the Public interest  ‚Äì Art 302 \\nauthorizes Pa rliament to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or \\ninter course between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India \\nas may be required in the public interest.  \\n\\uf0b7 State‚Äüs power to regulate trade and commerce ‚Äì Art 304 (a) empowers the State to \\nimpose any tax on goods imported from other State if similar goods in the State are \\nsubject to similar tax so as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods \\nmanufactured or produced in the State.  \\n\\uf0b7 Saving of existi ng laws  ‚Äì Art 305 saves existing laws and laws providing for State \\nmonopolies in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct. In  Saghir Ahmad v.  \\nState of U.P . The Supreme Court raised the question whether an Act providing for State \\nmonopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and \\ncommerce, guaranteed by Art. 301, but left the question undecided. Art 19 was \\namended by the Consti tution (first Amendment) Act in order to take out such State \\nmonopolies out of the purview of Art. 19 (1)(g). But no corresponding provision was \\nadded to Art 305.  \\n\\uf0b7 It appears from the judgement of the Supreme Court that in spite of such an \\namendment a law introducing such State monopoly might have to be justified before the  \\ncourts as being ‚Äúin the public interest‚Äù   or as amounting to a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù under Art.306 \\n(b) of the Constitution.
